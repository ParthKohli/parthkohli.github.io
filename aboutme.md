I'm a senior year Applied Mathematics student at [IIT Roorkee](https://iitr.ac.in). My interests vary by the minute, but vastly, I'm interested in mathematics, scientific computing, and computer systems. Some key facts about me are presented below:

* I came into existence on 27th July, 1999 in [Kanpur, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanpur).
* I attended [Summer Fields School](https://sfsdlf.com/) for 14 years in Gurgaon, India (also my hometown).
* I half-assedly wrote JEE Advanced in 2017.
* It's 2020, and I'm now entering my fourth year in college.
