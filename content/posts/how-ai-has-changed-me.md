LLMs have transformed the world in the last three years. Here are some notes on how they have changed my life so far:

### Feeling Better

LLMs helped me eliminate anxiety that was rooted in serious inferiority complex. Knowing that I can now learn anything at any desired depth by talking to an LLM, I feel more secure and confident when I encounter a new subject knowing that there is an accessible and controllable way to learn it. I am much happier and much less fearful of the unknown. The web (with search engines) must have had a similar effect in the 90s for a lot of that generation.

That was fortunately the only extent of my issues at the time, and I don't have much more to say here. I have not used AI as a therapist, but I support people who use it occasionally and think of it as a healthy coping mechanism, if not a solution.  

### Thinking Less

I am a software engineer, and like many of my peers, supervise LLMs with long prompts to make one-line edits instead of writing the damn code. A small percentage of old-timers resist AI-assisted coding, believing that it is a marketing fad forced on their colleagues by leadership. The fact is that most adoption of AI at work and in life is completely organic and driven by the principle of least effort. Humans are lazy, and software engineers are the laziest form of humans.
 
The "vibe" in "vibe coding" is a surprisingly effective description of my mental state, even though I do not subscribe to the practice[^1]. I reason about the codebase in System 2, but I verify code changes in System 1. 

I use AI to produce code for languages I have never learned, and could not tell you how the language syntax *really* works. In these cases, I rely on superficial signals: instincts, contextual cues and low-level pattern matching rather than any real knowledge. Working reactively instead of actively. 

It's funny that I am now the same pattern-matching machine that early-generation LLMs were, while the new-generation LLMs have far better understanding and reliability than an average human like me. 

It's easy to misinterpret this as the flow state because you get work done without applying a lot of conscious effort. But it is actually the polar opposite - flow involves accessing the highest form of thinking, whereas this is the lowest.

A lot of coding feels like completing a chore with no real sense of accomplishment. There are fewer stories and experiences you can share with colleagues about the technologies you supposedly closely work with, because a lot of them stem from the journey and the mistakes *you* made. That personal experience is lost.

### Personality
- Redefining personal moat. It used to be outperforming people at competitive programming / math, self-worth attached to academic track-record. I like to think that I traded that edge against socialising. Now that everyone can write code equivalent to (formerly) mid-level engineers, I need to develop longer-term thinking.
- Provenance, chain of trust, can I trace this back to a human? Different from tribalism.
