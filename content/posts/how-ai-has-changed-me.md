LLMs have transformed the world in the last three years. Here are some notes on how they have changed my life so far:

### Feeling

LLMs helped me eliminate anxiety that was rooted in serious inferiority complex. Knowing that I can now learn anything at any desired depth by talking to an LLM, I feel more secure and confident when I encounter a new subject knowing that there is an accessible and controllable way to learn it. I am much happier and much less fearful of the unknown. The web (with search engines) must have had a similar effect in the 1990s for a lot of that generation.

That was fortunately the only extent of my issues, and I don't have much more to say here. I have not used AI as a therapist, but I support people who use it occasionally and think of it as a healthy coping mechanism, if not a solution.  

### Thinking

I am a software engineer. Like many of my peers, I would rather write a wall of text to a model to change a line of code instead of just writing the damn code. A small percentage of old-timers resist AI-assisted coding, believing that it is a marketing fad forced on their colleagues by leadership. The fact is that most adoption of AI at work and in life is completely organic and driven by the principle of least effort. Humans are lazy, and software engineers are the laziest form of humans.
 
The "vibe" in "vibe coding" is a surprisingly effective description of my mental state, even though I do not subscribe to the practice[^1]. I reason about the codebase in System 2, but I verify code changes in System 1. 

I use AI to produce code for languages I have never learned, and still cannot recall enough to be able to write "Hello World". This is the consequence of relying on primal signals: instincts, contextual cues and low-level pattern matching rather than grounding in any real knowledge. Working reactively instead of actively. 

It's funny that I am now the same pattern-matching machine that early-generation LLMs were, while new-generation LLMs have far better understanding and reliability than me. 

It's easy to misinterpret this as the flow state because you get work done without applying a lot of conscious effort. But it is actually the polar opposite - flow involves accessing the highest form of thinking, whereas this is the lowest.

A lot of coding feels like completing a chore with no real sense of accomplishment. There are fewer stories and experiences you can share with colleagues about the technologies you closely work with, because a lot of them stem from the journey and the mistakes *you* made. That personal experience is lost. 

I try to counteract these cognitive effects of AI by not using it in my personal projects, including in this blog post.

### Being

People want to protect their strongest suit, their exclusive personal feature that makes them stand out. For a software engineer like me, that is intelligence and creativity. I was not gifted by any means, but I was an asset. I was at a top institute in India, and I outperformed my peers at competitive programming and academics. It was a trade-off: I did not have a social life outside of a few good friends. You win some, you lose some.

I kept in touch with these hobbies after starting my professional career in 2022 with a concrete desire to become a stable grandmaster at some point. That did not quite pan out because of how intelligent AI got in that timeframe. The goal eventually became irrelevant as AI started solving super-difficult problems to the point that I no longer think Codeforces ratings are a meaningful metric because of the rampant, undetectable use of AI in contests. I have the same concern for software engineering: even if AI can only become as good as the best human software engineer (which is unlikely to be the limit), what about the rest of us?

I have noticed that I care a lot more about the real world and humans now, even online. I gravitate towards places with human-generated content, and instantly filter out anything that looks like ChatGPT-ese regardless of its quality. I agree with Sam Altman that we will increasingly cherish human connection as we keep improving and collaborating with these machines.
